<p>I want to get more into the specific CFD workflow the team and I have been following this season.</p>

<p>Taking the simplified CAD model from <a href="https://pidduuu.github.io/jekyll/update/2023/11/01/Suspension-Considerations-for-Aerodynamics.html">Suspension Considerations for Aerodynamics</a> we export a STEP AP214 file and import it into Ansys Fluent. From here, we use various tools to clean up the geometry and preapre it for meshing.</p>

<p>I prefer to use Fluid Flow (Fluent with Fluent Meshing) since it has a very nice integrated workflow for both pre and post-processing.</p>

<p>First order of business is to use SpaceClaim. I havenâ€™t had good experiences with the stability of Discovery, and DesignModeler is very old at this point. SpaceClaim is relatively more stable from my experience, and after using it 30-40 times over it becomes intuitive.</p>
