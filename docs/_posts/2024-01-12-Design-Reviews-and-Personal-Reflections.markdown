With design coming to a close for EV5, I've certainly learned a lot about aerodynamic design and project management. This post aims to recap the 3 design reviews we have had this past season and summarize the lessons learned.

Being very wordy with this one, less images. Hope this is insightful nonetheless.

# September 29, 2023: Meeting Danny Jierian
After FSAE Michigan EV 2023 I was informed from [Jordan Van Dam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordanvandam/) (thermal management wizard) of the existence of [Danny Jierian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danny-jierian/) (professional thermal management wizard) who turned out to be one of the most influential factors in the development of EV5's aerodynamics package.

The goal of this first meeting was to determine whether or not our level of justification as a first-year aero team was good, and if we were even on the right track with our approach.

15 minutes in and [we started talking about tires](https://pidduuu.github.io/jekyll/update/2023/10/01/Justification-for-Aerodynamics.html), from which we received nods of approval to indicate we are indeed on the right track. "All aero judges are tire judges," he says.

Further praise was received when we talked about our MATLAB lap simulation program which was used to determine our ClA and CdA ceilings. There's a specific FBD he really liked that we should include in our files to show at competition, shown below.

This concluded our talks about justification, then we moved onto where our design was at so far. Starting with airfoil selection, his first suggestion was to add a legend to the plots and/or export the plots into Excel so it would be much more clear to read. This I was expecting to hear and plan to implement next year, I just didn't have time this year due to having to build up both the design, and subteam infrastructure, from scratch after 3 years of inactivity.

Another comment he had about our airfoil selection was we included Reynolds numbers which ranged from 3-5m/s for our chosen chord lengths. This is when he made me realize that aerodynamic grip is negligible at these speeds compared to mechanical grip, so our search for airfoils should primarily be conducted around 15-20m/s. This was a good point which I fully agreed on.

I briefly touched on manufacturing to explain that we are doing a [mouldless construction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsT561opKrU&t=166s&ab_channel=EasyCompositesLtd) this year to save money and man-power. He liked this.

For the latter half of the meeting, he really started to emphasize the importance of an undertray. I already knew a sculpted floor is the best bang for buck when it comes to L/D, however he opened my eyes to [just how effective it can be](https://www.instagram.com/p/C0-ewKJhF2C/?hl=en&img_index=1) when done right.

The meeting ended with him telling us just how proud he was that he didn't see or hear mention of 3D CFD after an hour-long talk. This was some nice social validation that we were doing the work as engineers, not artists.

**Lessons learned:**
- Make better plots for airfoil selection
- Analyze aero at 15-20m/s, not 3-5m/s
- Look into designing an undertray (maybe for next year, if we don't have time/money this year)

# November 26, 2023: Internal Design Review
With design freeze fast approaching, all mechanical subteams came together to review each other's designs.
