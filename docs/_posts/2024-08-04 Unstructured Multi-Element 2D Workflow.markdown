MSES did not want to plot results for cases with large amounts of flow separation. For FSAE we need to be able to push into the flow separation regime to find the optimal multi-element wing setups.

Below is the new 2D CFD workflow MACFE will follow, and it uses unstructured meshes. Included in this article is the error between structured and unstructured meshes and [Selig's experimental data](https://m-selig.ae.illinois.edu/pd.html).
