Through this portfolio I will attempt to track my growth as an engineer, from both a technical and emotional perspective.

For the time being, I think my posts will comprise mainly of projects I'm working on, thoughts I have surrounding certain subjects, and ideas I have for future endeavours.

With that being said, I want this to be more than a technical portfolio. I hope it captures my soul as well. Setting aside the socially-accepted image that an engineer has the emotional quotient of a stone, a pre-requisite to being an engineer is an emotional connection to the universe. Living things are affected by our work, no matter what the technical pursuit is.
